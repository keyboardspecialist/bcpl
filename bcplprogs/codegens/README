This directory BCPL/bcplprogs/codegens contains the following file.

cg68k.b
This was written om december 1980 and modified to run under the Tripos
portable operating in November 1981.
It is a standalone program that reads the numerical representation of
OCODE dating from the 1980s and generate position independent machine code
for the Motorala 68000 represented by a sequence of 32-bit words in hex
preceeded by the word t.hunk (=1000) follow by a word givinfg the number
of words of code. This is the format used by the Tripos system.
It can be compiled using the modern BCPL system using the command:
  c b cg6k
But it is meant to be called from te BCPL frontend. It interface to the
frontend can be modified by copying the way BCPL/cintcode/com/bcplcgcin.b
is implemented. Of course some of the recent extensions will not be
handled by cg68k.b.

cg8086.b
This in a BCPL Codegenerator for the Intel 8086 microprocessor dating
from 1982. It generates code for 16-bit BCPL and needs to be interfaced
with 16-bit frontends from the 1980s such as tose for the LSI4, the PDP11
or the Nova. These can be found i the Archive distribution.

cg-intcode.b
This is a codegenerator to Intcode which is a very simple assembly
language for a trivially simple interpretive code for BCPL. It was
designed to provide a way to transfer the BCPL compiler on paper tape
or cards to distant places such as Australia.

interp.b
This is an assembler and interpreter in BCPL for Intcode which needed
to be hand translated into a language available on the destination
machine.

cgmips.b
This is a codegenerator for the MIPS machine, a 32-bit RISC architecture.

cgpdp11.b
A codegenerator of the Digital PDP11/45 machines used by the Systems
research Group in the 1980s. A 16-bit bit byte addressed machine.
