# This file contains parameters for the dnaplot program
# that draws a 3D image of a DNA sequence. The image is like
# the flight of an aircraft with each letter in the sequence
# affecting the setting of the airlerons and elevator. The
# following is a typical setting for the letter A.

# A -15.4 +20.56 200 150   0

# This means the aircraft rotates 15.4 degrees to the left
# followed by pulling the stick back causing a clockwise
# rotation of 20.56 degrees about the axis of the right hand wing.
# The three numbers that follow specify the RGB component of
# the 3D edge for all occurencies of letter A.

# There are similar parameters for letters C, G and T.

# The image is displayed on the screen. There are controls to
# cause the image to be rotated and view from any distance.

# The following a a possible senting of the parameters.

A -15.4 +20.56 200 150   0
C +15.4 +20.56 100 240 100
G -15.4 -20.56   0 230 180
T +15.4 -20.56  50  70 250

# The image is just a sequence of coloured lines following
# the 3D path specified by the genome sequence and the above
# parameters.
