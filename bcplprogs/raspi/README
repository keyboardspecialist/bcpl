This directory holds the source code of the programs discribed in the
document bcpl4raspi.pdf and their compilations. the following seguence
of commands show how they can be compiled and run, in more or less the
order in which they occur in bcpl4raspi.pdf.

The first programs do not use SDL or OpengGL and can be compiled and
run on the Raspberry Pi using a version of cintsys created using any
of the makefiles: MakefileRaspi, MakefileRaspiSDL and MakefileRaspiGL.

The next set of programs use SDL and can be compiled and run on the
Raspberry Pi using a version of cintsys created using either
MakefileRaspiSDL or MakefileRaspiGL.

The final set of programs use OpengGL and must use a version of cintsys
created using MakefileRaspiGL.

c b gltst
gltst            -- Control the image using the arror keys,
                 -- ',' '.' and 'q'.

c b gltiger
gltiger          -- Use the controls as for gltst.
