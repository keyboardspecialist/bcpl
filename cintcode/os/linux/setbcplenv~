# One way to set the BCPLROOT, BCPLPATH, BCPLHDRS, BCPLSCRIPTS
# and PATH environment variables for the BCPL Cintcode and
# Cintpos systems. It can be used, possibly with minor edits,
# on most Linux and Cygwin systems.

# Add a line similar to the following near the end of the
# file .bashrc which should be in your home directory.

# . $(HOME)/distribution/cintcode/os/linux/setbcplenv

# The following are for 32 bit BCPL
export BCPLROOT=$HOME/distribution/BCPL/cintcode
export BCPLPATH=$BCPLROOT/cin
export BCPLHDRS=$BCPLROOT/g
export BCPLSCRIPTS=$BCPLROOT/s

# The following are for 64 bit BCPL
export BCPL64ROOT=$HOME/distribution/BCPL/cintcode
export BCPL64PATH=$BCPL64ROOT/cin64
export BCPL64HDRS=$BCPL64ROOT/g
export BCPL64SCRIPTS=$BCPL64ROOT/s

# The following are for 32 bit Cintpos
export POSROOT=$HOME/distribution/Cintpos/cintpos
export POSPATH=$POSROOT/cin
export POSHDRS=$POSROOT/g
export POSSCRIPTS=$POSROOT/s

# The following are for 64 bit Cintpos
export POS64ROOT=$HOME/distribution/Cintpos/cintpos
export POS64PATH=$POS64ROOT/cin64
export POS64HDRS=$POS64ROOT/g
export POS64SCRIPTS=$POS64ROOT/s

# The following are for the Mus header files used by playmus
export MUSHDRS=$HOME/distribution/Musprogs/g

export PATH=$BCPLROOT/bin:$POSROOT/bin:$POS64ROOT/bin:$PATH

# Note that BCPLROOT and POSROOT must be the absolute filenames.
