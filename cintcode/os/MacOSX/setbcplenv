# This is the script file to setup the environment variables
# needed by the BCPL Cintcode System.

# It assumes the bash shel is being used. If zsh or some other
# shell is in used I recommend thatt you update your account to
# use bash by running the following command 'chsh -s /bin/bash'
# then close andreopen your terminal window.

# The environment variable HOME should have already been set to
# the absolute filename of your home directory. This can be
# checked by the command: echo $HOME
# On my MacMini computer this outputs:
#/Users/mr10

# So that the BCPL environment variables are always setup I
# recommend that you add the following line near the end of
# both ~/.profile and ~/.bashrc.
# . $HOME/distribution/BCPL/cintcode/os/MacOSX/setbcplenv
